## NYC Traffic Accidents and Subway Ridership Analysis
This project explores the relationship between traffic accidents and subway ridership in New York City using datasets sourced from Kaggle. Our analysis focuses on understanding spatial, temporal, and borough-level patterns in accidents and ridership. By integrating interactive visualizations, we aim to uncover insights into how urban factors influence traffic safety.

## NYC Traffic Accidents in 2022
This interactive map provides a detailed visualization of traffic accidents across New York City's boroughs during 2022. Blue dots represent accident sites, with the density and clustering indicating hotspots where accidents are most frequent. Key insights can be drawn by examining areas with high dot concentrations, such as major roads, intersections, and transportation hubs.

## Subway Ridership vs. Accidents by Borough in 2022
The bar chart compares subway ridership levels (scaled by 1,000) to traffic accident counts for each borough during a user-selected date range. For instance, in the shown range (02/01/2022 to 02/07/2022), Manhattan exhibits significantly higher subway ridership and fewer accidents compared to other boroughs, reflecting the impact of extensive public transportation infrastructure. In contrast, boroughs like Brooklyn and Queens show lower ridership and relatively higher accident rates.
